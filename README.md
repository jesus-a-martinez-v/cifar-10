# cifar-10
Simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network used to classify objects in the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset, developed as part of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)..

## What you'll need

You can install the tools by running this handy command :)

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, all the details are [here](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/cifar-10/blob/master/image_classification.ipynb). Feel free to tweak, poke and experiment as much as you want!
